To infinity and beyond - Waiting for the page to load... Forever.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
PoC: http://patience.cf/ - Yes the page does work. You're just going to have to wait forever. Literally.

### Can this crash a Browser?
Possibly. This depends on the sensitivity and structure of your Web Browser.

### How do I know that the page is not just being DDoS'd or something?

**tl;dr**, refer to http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ and see for yourself.
